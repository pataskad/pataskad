# Who Am I? #
- As a very naturally curious person in all aspects of my life, I value the 'why' just as much as the 'how', and actively seek to better understand the current industry, including where it's going, and especially how I can fit into that picture and grow along with the rest of the industry to actively contribute to high output teams, all with a smile on my face and a good attitude. I strive to fit cohesively within just about any team in this market by completing projects efficiently while also maintaining a growth mindset to keep up with ever-changing standards and tooling.

# Current Professional Focus (May 2022) #
- I am currently working as a Junior Front End Developer since March 2022.  Loving the field so far!  Still focusing on soaking up as much information and wisdom from others around me as I can.  I wake up excited each day because I know I'm going to learn something new and interesting, which will directly play into furthering my own abilities and decision making skills.

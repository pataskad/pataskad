# Who Am I? #
- Hello there! My name is Dallas Pataska, and I am a full-stack developer focusing in on writing clean HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (inluding full stack implementations), and in a lesser capacity, Python, tied into the Django framework. 
- As a very naturally curious person in all aspects of my life, I value the 'why' just as much as the 'how', and actively seek to better understand the current industry, including where it's going, and especially how I can fit into that picture and grow along with the rest of the development world to continuously build upon layers of knowledge across mulitiple tech stacks and development technologies necessary for this industry. I can fit into almost any team's culture seamlessly while enhancing the work environment and providing a friendly, but efficient teammate to lean on and help produce fitting solutions to business problems.

# Current Focus (As of January 2022) #
- My current routine is going through the 'The Odin Project' curriculum as I continue to build up my programming portfolio and skillset while venturing further into the full stack JavaScript realm of development, done via node.js/express. This also includes other topics such as learning and using tools such as npm, webpack, React and other workflow enhancements/libraries/devTools as an effort to streamline my learning to better align with current industry practices. 

# What Am I About? #
- I am curious about every aspect of the web development process, from project planning and designing to deployment. I have been fascinated by all the incredible things coding makes possible ever since I began my journey in 2020, no matter how small or large the example may be, and I look forward to getting up each day eager to find out what new information I'm going to read about or implement on any given day!

- I am currently looking for an opportunity to join a group of developers working within the JavaScript intensive corner of full-stack development, or with the Python/Django stack as I continue to strive towards being a self-sufficient developer that creates and maintains clean and efficient solutions for businesses all while maintaining a friendly attitude to continue growing and developing not only my own, but other's skillsets as well to elevate those around myself just as much, if not more.

# How To Get In Touch #
- The best way to reach me is via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dallas-pataska/), I greatly look forward to to working and learning from those who come before myself, as well as becoming a valuable resource to anybody who might go down this path after me :)

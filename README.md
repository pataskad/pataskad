- Hello there! My name is Dallas Pataska, and I am an up and coming full-stack developer specializing in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and Python via the Django web framework.

- I am curious about almost every aspect of the web development process, from project planning and designing to deployment, I have been fascinated by all the amazing things coding makes capable within the online realm ever since I began my journey mid-2020, and can't wait to continue learning more!
- As a very naturally curious person in all aspects of my life, I value the 'why' just as much as the 'how', and actively strive to understand the current industry, including where it's going, and how I can fit into that picture and grow along with the rest of the digital development world to continuously build upon layers of knowledge across mulitiple tech stacks and development technologies necessary for this industry. 

- I am currently looking for an opportunity to join a group of developers working within the Django/Python stack, or Javascript heavy realm of full-stack development as I continue to strive towards being a self-sufficient developer that develops and generates clean and efficient solutions to the digital environment while maintaining a friendly attitude to continue growing and developing not only my own, but others skillsets just as much as my own.

- The best way to reach me is via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dallas-pataska/), I greatly look forward to to working and learning from those who come before myself, as well as being a valued resource to anybody who might go down this path after me :)

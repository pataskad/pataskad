# Who Am I? #
- Hello there! My name is Dallas Pataska, and I am a full-stack developer focusing in on HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and in a smaller capacity Python via the Django framework. 
- As a very naturally curious person in all aspects of my life, I value the 'why' just as much as the 'how', and actively strive to understand the current industry, including where it's going, and especially how I can fit into that picture and grow along with the rest of the development world to continuously build upon layers of knowledge across mulitiple tech stacks and development technologies necessary for this industry. I can fit into almost any team's culture seamlessly to enhance the work environment and provide a friendly, but efficient coworker regardless of hierarchy status.

# Current Focus (As of November 2021) #
- My current routine is going through the 'The Odin Project' curriculum as I continue to build up my programming skillset and venture further into the JavaScript realm of development, and this includes frontend and back end via node.js, as well as other topics such as learning and using tools such as npm, webpack, React and other workflow enhancements as an effort to streamline my learning to better fit current industry standard practices. 

# What Am I About? #
- I am curious about every aspect of the web development process, from project planning and designing to deployment I have been fascinated by all the amazing things coding makes possible ever since I began my journey in 2020, and can't wait to continue learning more with each passing day!

- I am currently looking for an opportunity to join a group of developers working within the JavaScript intensive corner of full-stack development, or with the Django/Python stack as I continue to strive towards being a self-sufficient developer that creates and maintains clean and efficient solutions to the digital environment while maintaining a friendly attitude to continue growing and developing not only my own, but other's skillsets just as much as my own.

# How To Get In Touch #
- The best way to reach me is via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dallas-pataska/), I greatly look forward to to working and learning from those who come before myself, as well as being a valued resource to anybody who might go down this path after me :)

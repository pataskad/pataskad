# Current Focus #
- My current working routine is going through the 'The Odin Project' curriculum as I continue to build up my programming skillset and venture further into the JavaScript realm of development, and this includes frontend and back end via node.js. 
# Who Am I? #
- Hello there! My name is Dallas Pataska, and I am an up and coming full-stack developer focusing in on HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Python via the Django web framework specifically. 
# What Am I About? #
- I am curious about almost every aspect of the web development process, from project planning and designing to deployment, I have been fascinated by all the amazing things coding makes capable within the online realm ever since I began my journey mid-2020, and can't wait to continue learning more!
- As a very naturally curious person in all aspects of my life, I value the 'why' just as much as the 'how', and actively strive to understand the current industry, including where it's going, and especially how I can fit into that picture and grow along with the rest of the digital development world to continuously build upon layers of knowledge across mulitiple tech stacks and development technologies necessary for this industry. 

- I am currently looking for an opportunity to join a group of developers working within the Django/Python stack, or JavaScript heavy realm of full-stack development as I continue to strive towards being a self-sufficient developer that develops and generates clean and efficient solutions to the digital environment while maintaining a friendly attitude to continue growing and developing not only my own, but others skillsets just as much as my own.
# How To Get In Touch #
- The best way to reach me is via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dallas-pataska/), I greatly look forward to to working and learning from those who come before myself, as well as being a valued resource to anybody who might go down this path after me :)

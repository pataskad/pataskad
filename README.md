- Hello there! My name is Dallas Pataska, and I am an up and coming full-stack developer specializing in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and Python via the Django web framework

- I am interested in just about every aspect of the web development process, from project planning and designing to deployment, I have been fascinated by all the amazing things coding makes capable within the online realm ever since I began my journey mid-2020
- As a very naturally curious person in all aspects of my life, I value the 'why' just as much as the 'why', and actively strive to understand the current industry, where it's going, and how I can fit into that picture and grow along with the rest of the digital development world

- I am currently looking for an opportunity to join a group of developers working within the Django/Python stack realm of full-stack development as I continue to grow into being a self-sufficient developer that creates and designs clean and efficient solutions to the digital environment while maintaining a friendly atmosphere to continue growing and developing not only my own, but others skillsets around myself as well

- The best way to reach me is via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dallas-pataska/), I greatly look forward to to working and learning from those who come before myself, as well as being a valued resource to anybody who might go down this path after me :)
